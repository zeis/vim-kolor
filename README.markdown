Kolor
=====

Colorful Vim color scheme with 256 color terminal support.

Designed to have high text readability and optimal visibility of every element, and to be eye comfortable as well.

## Installation

Just copy `kolor.vim` to `~/.vim/colors` (on Windows `<your-vim-dir>\vimfiles\colors`). Or for global accessibility, `/usr/share/vim/vimfiles/colors`.

Then add the line `colorscheme kolor` in your `vimrc` file, and restart Vim.

If you use Pathogen, the directory structure is compatible.

## Donations

If you want to make a donation, rather, consider to help the Uganda children on Vim's website.

This color scheme is dedicated to them.

## Self-promotion
